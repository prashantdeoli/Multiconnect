**Status:** OPEN BLOCKERS ⚠️

## Signals Reviewed

- Phase-1 gate: `READY ✅`
- Pending acceptance items in baseline report: `2`

## Open Blockers

- Acceptance item pending: Is there audible crackle/popping under current buffer strategy?
- Acceptance item pending: Does app/UI responsiveness degrade while native routing runs?

## Recommended Next Step

- If blockers remain, resolve the listed acceptance items and rerun `./scripts/run_native_checks.sh`.
- If no blockers remain, keep running weekly evidence refresh and signoff checks.
